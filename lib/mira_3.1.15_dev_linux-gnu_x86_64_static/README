1. What's new?
==============

Important notice: quite a number or switches had to be changed since the 2.8.x
and the 2.9.16x1 releases. Existing parameter files need to be adapted.

For a complete list of changes since a specific version, please consult
CHANGES.txt (included in this binary package).



2. What's provided?
===================

The binary package consists of binaries, documentation, a directory with small
demos (for normal Sanger type sequences) and a directory with some support
files.

Binaries provided: 
 - mira: for assembly of genome sequences
 - miramem: estimating memory needed to assemble projects. Realised through
   link to mira.
 - convert_project: for converting project file types into other types
 - caf2fasta, caf2gbf, caf2text, caf2html, gbf2caf and gbf2fasta are some
   frequently used file converters (realised through links to convert_project)
 - scftool: set of tools useful when working with SCF trace files
 - fastatool: set of tools useful when working with FASTA trace files

Scripts provided:
 - fasta2frag.tcl: fragmenting sequences into smaller, overlapping
   subsequences. Useful for simulating shotgun sequences. Can create
   subsequences in both directions (/default) and also paired-end sequences.
 - fastaselect.tcl: given a FATSA file (and possibly a FASTA quality file) and
   a file with names of reads, select the sequences from the input FASTA (and
   quality file) and writes them to an output FASTA
 - fixACE4consed.tcl: Consed has a bug which incapacitates it from reading
   consensus tags in ACE files written by the MIRA assembler (and possibly
   other programs). This script massages an ACE file so that consed can read
   the consensus tags.


3. Installation
===============

The binaries (in directory "bin") are statically linked and self
contained, they should work with any Linux kernel >=2.6.

Copy the binaries (and scripts if you want) into a directory in your path
environment (or add the extraction directory to your path variable) and you
are ready to go.

Support files for the Staden GAP4 assembly finishing tool and consed are in
the "support" directory. Please refer to the documentation of the respective
package on how to integrate them into your environment.

You can install the manual files by copying them into a "man" directory of
your system.


4. Documentation
================

Documentation in man, html and texinfo format can be found in the 'docs'
directory.

Provided files:
 - mira(.html|.1|.info)
 - mira_usage(.html|.1|.info)
 - mira_454dev (.html|.1|.info)
 - mira_solexadev (.html|.1|.info)
 - mira_hard (.html|.1|.info)
 - mira_faq (.html|.1|.info)
 - mira_logfiles (.html|.1|.info)

The main documentation resides in the first file (mira...). If you are new to
MIRA, I suggest you read at least the short introduction in the
"mira_usage..." file. This will provide you a basic toolset for getting
started with MIRA. For 454 data, please have a look at the corresponding help
file.


5. Demos
========

A few small usage examples for genomic and EST assembly are in the
'minidemo' directory. As the demos rely on file links, this directory
will have to be unpacked under a Unix operating system. Unpacking it
with WinZip/WinRAR/other Windows applications and then transferring
the directory to Linux will NOT work.

Simply go into the directory and execute the runme.sh scripts (and have a look
at them if you wish).
