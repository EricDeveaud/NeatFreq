documents.


README for assembling 454 sequences with MIRA
=============================================

To show how MIRA behaves in 454 or 454/Sanger hybrid assemblies, please follow
the walkthrough guides given in the manual for 454 assemblies.


EST-assembly with 454 reads:
----------------------------
While I have a data set with 454 ESTs, I currently have no time to work on
this. In theory, MIRA should be able to assemble 454 data well enough, but
probably one needs to write a cleaning pipeline for the data.

If anyone volunteers to try out, please go ahead (I'll help where I can).


Paired end sequences with 454 reads:
------------------------------------
This is covered in the walkthrough guides given in the manual for 454
assemblies.


Short FAQ:
----------
0) Q: Where do I start?
   A: First, read the help file "mira_454dev.html" (or corresponding man
      page), they're both located in the "docs" directory.
      Second, I strongly suggest you try out the walkthrough for Bceti data as
      given in this file.

1) Q: Why do I need to use sequence clipping information? 454 does not use
      sequencing vectors and the complete sequence should be usable?
   A: 454 uses a technology that relies on defined sequence adaptors. These
      adaptors are also partially sequenced and hence are (maybe partially)
      present in the SFF files (and in converted FASTA files if one does not
      pay attention when converting).
      For an assembler, these adaptors behave exactly like sequencing vectors
      from Sanger sequencing: they are deadly for the assembly.
      Therefore, take care either not to have the adaptor sequences in your
      FASTAs or if you do, have the TRACEINFO XML file carry the information
      on clippings, then nothing can happen.

2) Q: I need to reduce memory consumption for the 454 assembly
   A: Increase both -SK:pr and -AL:mrs to 90. This will however have as side
      effect that weaker matches might be missed and therefore a some more
      contigs as result (and some more reads ending up in the debris). The 454
      assembler (Newbler) runs with a similar parameter of 90.
      Also, for eukaryotes, you can try to reduce -SK:mhpr to lower values,
      perhaps as low as 50.
      If everything else fails, use -SK:mnr=yes (read about in the mira_hard
      help file).

3) Q: I have SFF files from the 454 sequencing, can MIRA use these?
   A: Not directly. You must transform these to CAFs or a combination of
      FASTA, FASTA qualities and NCBI TRACEINFO files. The easiest way to do
      this is sff_extract from Jose Blanca. Look up in the helpfile
      "mira_454dev.html" to see how the later is done. Or ask your sequencing
      provider to do this for you.

4) Q: Can MIRA use 454 paired-end reads?
   A: Yes. Look up in the helpfile "mira_454dev.html" to see how this is
      done.

5) Q: How much memory does one need to assemble 454 data with MIRA?
   A: Three factors have to come into consideration: the total amount of raw
      bases, the coverage and the repetitiveness of your genome. The last one
      is probably unknown before the assembly.
      To get a rough idea, start the "miramem" program and answer the
      questions appearing on the screen.

6) Q: How much disk space do I need?
   A: Quite a bit. Count in several gigabytes.

7) Q: Can MIRA use multiple cores or processors?
   A: Since 2.9.28x6, parts can. At the moment only the SKIM algorithm can run
      multiple threads (controlled by "-SK:not").
      However, there is a drawback: between different runs, assemblies might
      differ a bit in the low quality / low coverage areas. This cannot be
      helped at the moment without some tricky and memory consuming
      countermeasures. Personally, I consider this to be e nuisance, but a
      very minor one.


If you have any question regarding usage of MIRA with 454 or hybrid 454/Sanger
data, please subscribe to the MIRA talk mailing list (see
http://www.chevreux.org/mira_mailinglists.html) and send your question to:
mira_talk@freelists.org

Note: please make sure that the address you subscribe with and the address you
use for sending mails are the same, else they are filtered away by the mailing
list daemon.


Have fun with your assemblies,
