README for assembling Solexa sequences with MIRA
================================================

Mapping
-------

This functionality is rock-solid as I've used it in own projects for more than
2 years now. To give yiou an idea: for bacteria, with a bit of manual
cleaning (10 to 15 minutes for close relatives of the reference), one should
usually have found >99.99% of all mutations in a genome.

Starting with a coverage of ~6 to 8, MIRA reliably finds all kinds of SNPs in
the Solexa data. Please note: to attain a minimum coverage of 6 to 8 at most
positions in the genome, you need to have a theoretical average coverage of
approximately at least ~25 to ~30. Personally, I try to get my data at >= 30x


Major differences to ELAND when using MIRA in mapping mode:
- MIRA will find *all kinds* of SNPs in the data: base exchanges as well as
  indels.
- MIRA will also map reads to repetitive stretches in the genome
- MIRA can make a distinction between a SNP and a probably unresolved repeat
- MIRA performs a "sequence merging" that allows assembly projects for
  bacteria or small fungi to be loaded in current generation finishing tools
  (GAP4, consed etc) and also enhance the overview.
- MIRA is certainly slower (I do not have ELAND to perform timing comparisons)
- MIRA is probably quite a bit more memory intensive. You don't want to use it
  with more than 20 to 30 million reads or on genomes much larger than 100mb.



De-novo Solexa
--------------

MIRA can also do de-novo assemblies of Solexa.

While in the past the feature was more experimental, it has now attained a
stage where I think it is usable for bacteria. Slow, but usable.

It's going to be slow and memory hungry, but it works for me. Note: if you
want to do de-novo with only Solexa, try to get longer reads (70+ mers) and
paired-end. This helps a lot.

Note: Not really recommended when having Solexa coverages >>100x as MIRA gets
even slower and more memory hungry. Will be worked on.


De-novo hybrid Solexa/other
---------------------------

Hybrid assemblies of Solexa + other sequencing types: switched off in 2.9.46
to rework some code and back again in 2.9.48. The results are, at least those
I know of, really ... really good.

Warning: slower even than de-novo Solexa (but I'm working on that).

Note: Not really recommended when having Solexa coverages >>100x as MIRA gets
even slower and more memory hungry. Will be worked on.



Short FAQ:
----------
0) Q: Where do I start?
   A: First, read the help file "mira_solexadev.html" (or corresponding man
      page), they're both located in the "docs" directory.

1) Q: Can MIRA also perform de-novo assembly with Solexa data?
   A: Yes. Though it needs quite some memory, you probably want to do this
      only for bacteria or very small eukaryotes. And try to get hold on
      longer Solexa reads (76mers or more) and paired-end data.

2) Q: In what formats do I need to supply Solexa data?
   A: FASTA and FASTA quality file for the reads; GBF (GenBank format), FASTA
      or CAF for the backbone.

3) Q: What type do I need to give quality data?
   A: These can be either the "old" Solexa scores (starting at -40) or "phred"
      style quality values (starting at 0). See the -LR:ssiqf
      parameter. Starting in first half of 2009, Illumina changed their
      pipeline and you should get only "new" Solexa quality values after that.

4) Q: How should I perform hybrid assemblies of Sanger/Solexa, 454/Solexa or
      even Sanger/454/Solexa data?
   A: You can choose between full-hybrid assembly (giving all data at the same
      time) or a sequential assembly, first assembling long reads and then
      mapping Solexas against the resulting assembly. Note that when using CAF
      as input, this is still 'hybrid' assembly as unlike other assemblers,
      the backbone reference is not just a simple FASTA sequence, but the full
      assembly of the longer reads.

5) Q: How do I quickly find SNPs between the backbone and my assembled Solexa
      sequences?
   A: In finishing tools (GAP4, consed, others), search for the "SROc", "SIOc"
      or "SAOc" tags (in this order). Some indel SNPs are hiding as "WRMc"
      tags, you probably need to have a closer look at them. Last stop: "UNSc"
      tags.
      More about this in the main manual and themaual for Solexa data.

6) Q: How much memory does one need to assemble Solexa data with MIRA?
   A: Currently a lot. A rough estimate is ~1GB to 1.5GB RAM per million
      Solexa reads (36-40 mers, somewhat more for 50 or 75 mers).

7) Q: How much disk space do I need?
   A: Quite a bit, several gigabytes. Most of it you can be discarded after
      the assembly (log files).

8) Q: How long does MIRA need to assemble Solexa data?
   A: Depends whether mapping or de-novo, the organisms size and number of
      reads. As example, mapping 4.5m Solexa 36mers to a 4.2mb organism so
      that up to 5 errors (base change / insertion / deletion) are found takes
      21 minutes on my development system (using 4 processors). This time
      includes full quality control, trimming, SNP searching etc.

9) Q: Can MIRA use multiple cores or processors?
   A: Since 2.9.28x6, parts can. At the moment only the SKIM algorithm can run
      multiple threads. See "-GE:not" and "-SK:not".

10) Q: What's the largest number of bases an indel can have to be found by
       MIRA with Solexa data in mapping mode?
    A: Depends (as always) on your coverage, read quality and the length of
       your sequences.
       For 36mers, MIRA reliably finds and categorises indels of size 1, 2
       and 3, sometimes it also find 4 and 5. For 75 mers, indels of size 8
       are no problem, 9-12 are possible.
       Larger indels are not found per se (the reads don't map anymore to the
       backbone), but marker tags in the assembly point to the site with a
       "problem". When using paired-end reads and not merging them to the
       backbone, indels of larger sizes can be found.

11) Q: Are there any restrictions regarding the length of Solexa reads?
    A: To the lower end, MIRA has some hard cutoff at 20 bases. To the upper
       end, there are no real restrictions: you can have 36mer, 50mer, 76mers
       or anything larger than that (and smaller than 20kb)

Sanger/Solexa, 454/Solexa or even Sanger/454/Solexa data, please subscribe to
the MIRA talk mailing list (see

use for sending mails are the same, else they are filtered away by the mailing
list daemon.


Have fun with your assemblies,
